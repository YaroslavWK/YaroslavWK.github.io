Hello, I'm Yaroslav.

### More Information

I work as a Full Stack JavaScript developer.
I like coding very much.
This is both my job and my hobby.
I like to learn.
Every day I learn something new, I study online courses, read books and useful websites, and improve my skills.
"No man is born wise or learned."
A day lived without new knowledge is a lost day!
I maintain the website "Simple Tips", the group "React and Full Stack JS developers" on Facebook and Telegram-canal "Full Stack JavaScript developer" and own page â€” Yaroslav Web-Master .
I write articles on my blog, translate articles and dream of writing a complete guide to the MERN stack.
I participated in the program # 100DaysOfCode.
