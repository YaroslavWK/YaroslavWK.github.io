Hello, I'm Yaroslav.

### More Information

I work as a Full Stack JavaScript developer.
I like coding very much.
This is both my job and my hobby.
I like to learn.
Every day I learn something new, I study online courses, read books and useful websites, and improve my skills.
"No man is born wise or learned."
A day lived without new knowledge is a lost day!
I maintain the website ["Simple Tips"](http://abcinblog.blogspot.com/), the group "React and Full Stack JS developers" on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1786288918273718/) and Telegram-canal ["Full Stack JavaScript developer"](https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAFeP94ob6Z-T1Bab7A) and own page â€” [Yaroslav Web-Master](https://www.facebook.com/Yaroslav-Web-Master-1446556072148794/?modal=admin_todo_tour) .
I write articles on my blog, translate articles and dream of writing a complete guide to the MERN stack.
I participated in the program # 345DaysOfCode.
